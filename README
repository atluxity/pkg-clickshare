  Description     : Linux driver for ClickShare screen share system

We are considering to upload a non-free package with the ClickShare
driver for Linux into Debian.  The driver consist of two binary user
space programs and a udev rule to launch it when the dongle is inserted.
Based on the dependency list, we suspect it is sending snapshots of the
screen as a video stream to the TV or projector.
